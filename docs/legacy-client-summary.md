## Notes
This client was originally built as a web application and will need to be adapted for Apple devices. Key considerations for the migration:
1. Replace web-specific APIs with native iOS/macOS equivalents
2. Convert React web components to SwiftUI or UIKit components
3. Adapt the authentication flow for Apple's authentication system
4. Replace browser storage with native storage solutions
5. Optimize image processing for native performance
