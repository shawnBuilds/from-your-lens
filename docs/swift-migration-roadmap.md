# Swift Migration Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step process of migrating the web client to a native Swift application, focusing on iterative development and core functionality first.

## Checkpoint 1: Basic UI Foundation
**Goal**: Establish the basic app structure and landing page
- Create SwiftUI project with tab-based navigation
- Implement landing page with gallery card grid layout
- Set up basic app theming and styling

## Checkpoint 2: Photo Gallery Integration
**Goal**: Enable basic photo viewing functionality
- Implement PhotoKit integration for accessing iCloud photos
- Create photo grid view with lazy loading
- Add basic photo detail view with zoom capabilities

## Checkpoint 3: Core Photo Features
**Goal**: Implement essential photo manipulation features
- Add face detection using Vision framework
- Implement basic photo filtering and editing
- Create photo comparison view for side-by-side analysis

## Checkpoint 4: User Authentication
**Goal**: Set up secure user access
- Implement Sign in with Apple
- Create user profile management
- Set up secure local storage for user preferences

## Checkpoint 5: Photo Upload & Sharing
**Goal**: Enable photo management capabilities
- Implement photo upload to iCloud
- Add sharing functionality
- Create batch processing features

## Development Approach
- Each checkpoint should be treated as a working, testable version
- Focus on core functionality before adding advanced features
- Test thoroughly on both iOS and macOS targets
- Use SwiftUI for maximum code reuse between platforms

## Technical Considerations
- Use SwiftUI for UI components
- Implement MVVM architecture
- Utilize Combine for reactive programming
- Leverage native frameworks (PhotoKit, Vision, CloudKit)
